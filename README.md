# IMPORTANT! Statefull Services Approach
✨ **This app utilizes a stateful services approach** ✨

Which provides a robust and scalable solution for managing simple application state when there is no need to really on third party libraries like NGRX for example.
It's main purpose was to showcase my reactive approach interest, and my abilities to architecture reactive applications using plain streams.
If you're interested in exploring an alternative store-based approach, 
you can check out my Store-Based Implementation for a different perspective here:
